> Didlydoo is a revolutionary website that allows you to create events and let anyone add their availability to find the best date for everyone.

## The mission

You have been hired by a "truly disruptive" startup, to create a revolutionnary tool to plan events with friends and relatives. Introducing Didlydoo, the event planner!

A backend developer has already created an API for the tool, so you can focus on the frontend. The list of endpoints is available below.

Your tasks is to :

- ðŸŒ± Display all the events, including everyone's availability
- ðŸŒ± Allow users to create events
- ðŸŒ± Allow users to add their availability to an existing event
- ðŸŒ± Edit an event name/description/author
- ðŸŒ± Delete an event
- ðŸŒ¼ Display the best possible date according to availabilities
- ðŸŒ¼ Have a look at the backend code, try to change the message displayed on startup.

This is the mockup that the company founder has drawn on a piece of paper during a lunch break (you can use it, or create your own layout).

## Specific React tools to have

> This about the haves in the React tool-belt.

- ðŸŒ± React Routing system. cf: `'react-router-dom'`
- ðŸŒ± Styled components
- ðŸŒ± Uuid
- ðŸŒ¼ Framer-motion

## Advices
- Read the backend documentation carefully
- Draw the design, with the different pages, on a piece of paper
- Code the design with fakes datas
- Implement React components (have big components is good for a first draft)
- Identify the states
- Try to get the datas from the backend with `useState()`
- Implement the Router
- Add your logic to manage the states

# Backend setup

Clone the repo on your computer and open in it in a terminal, then type `npm install` once to install the dependencies.

To launch the server simply type `node server/index.mjs` to start the server (the terminal has to remain open and running).
